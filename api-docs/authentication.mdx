# Introduction

- Our API is based on REST architecture with responses in JSON format.
- The number of requests currently allowed: <b>up to 1 request per second.</b>
- Endpoints use a unique 32-character API KEY for each Casual or PRO plan member to authenticate user requests, as in the example below:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ'
```

- You can find your API KEY at: https://nerdapi.com/profile


## POST /key

- You can also make a POST request authenticating yourself to get your API KEY:

```javascript
fetch(`https://api.nerdapi.com/key`, {
		method: "POST",
		headers: { 
			"Content-Type": "application/json"
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			"email": "test@gmail.com",
			"password": "test123",
		})
	})
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(json => console.log(json));
```

```json Response Success
{
  	"success": true,
	"api_key": "Bearer eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ",
}
```

```json Response Fail
{
  	"success": false,
  	"message": "Invalid authentication or user not has a subscription active"
}
```
